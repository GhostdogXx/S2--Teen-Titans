## 📏 Rules, Practices and Principles

1. Project folder name starts with `WD-`.
2. The homepage file is named `index.html`.
3. File structure separates content by type (HTML, CSS, images).
4. Folders named based on usage (`css`, `img`, etc.).
5. Use **external CSS** only — no inline styles.
6. Use **camelCase** or **kebab-case** consistently for file names.
7. Structure:
